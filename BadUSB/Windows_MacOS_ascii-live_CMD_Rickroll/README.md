PLEASE READ

ME (PhoenixGod101), hugomd OR UberGuidoZ WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, THESE FILES ARE SAFE AND ANY HARM WILL BE THE USERS FAULT!!!

These two rickroll BadUSB files were created by PhoenixGod101 on GitHub
(https://github.com/PhoenixGod101)

These files do not cause any damage and only run a command in cmd or terminal that can be easily stopped by pressing the keybind CTRL+C

These two files open the terminal / command prompt on the device you are attacking and runs a command that utilises the GitHub Repository ascii-live made by hugomd
(https://github.com/hugomd)
(https://github.com/hugomd/ascii-live)

To use, just plug the flipper zero into the device you are attacking and then run the code from your flipper. You may do this over Bluetooth too.

Testing and Compatibility:
These files have both been tested and both work. They were tested on Momentum FW using a USB connection. These files should work on any firmware, and should work over Bluetooth but haven't been tested using Bluetooth.

Please Note:
When using on apple, you may be given a pop up about keyboard settings, you do not need to worry about this and you may click quit. To counter this, plug your flipper into the apple device you wish to attack before the actual attack is run and quit the pop up. The device should remember the choice to quit the pop up and it should not appear again when you next do the attack on the same device.
